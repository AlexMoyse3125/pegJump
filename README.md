# pegJump
Peg Jump Solver by Alex Moyse.

Solves the classic game "peg jump" that can be found at Cracker Barrel.  Uses a recursive function to simulate possible moves, keeping track of successful moves.  Click on a peg to select and click a legal move for the peg to make a hop, the program will print a list of legal moves.  The numbering of the moves starts with 0 at the top and ends with 14 at the bottom right.
